# Task: Robustness and Debug Output in copy_web_diagrams.sh

## Description

The `copy_web_diagrams.sh` script was exiting with code 1 even when no real error occurred, and debug output was always printed. This caused confusion in the build process and made it harder to diagnose real errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Script only prints debug output in verbose mode
- [x] Script exits 0 on success
- [x] Real errors are reported clearly

## Implementation Notes

- Updated script to print debug output only if verbose mode is enabled
- Ensured script always exits 0 unless a real error occurs
- Added explicit exit and improved messaging
