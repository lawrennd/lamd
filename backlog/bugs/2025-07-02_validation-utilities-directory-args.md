# Task: Validation Utilities for Directory Arguments

## Description

The validation utilities did not provide clear error messages or support for multiple include paths, making it difficult to diagnose configuration issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Validation errors are clear and actionable
- [x] Multiple include paths are supported
- [x] Directory argument validation is robust

## Implementation Notes

- Updated `validation.py` to improve error messages
- Added support for colon-separated lists for include paths
- Tested validation with various configurations
