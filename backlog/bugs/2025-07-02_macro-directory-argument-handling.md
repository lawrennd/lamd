# Task: Macro Directory Argument Handling in mdpp and Makefiles

## Description

After refactoring `mdpp.py` for testability, the macro directory argument (`--macros` â†’ `--macros-path`) was not consistently updated in all Makefiles, leading to missing macro expansion and broken outputs. This caused issues with slides, posts, and other outputs that rely on macro expansion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All Makefiles use `--macros-path=$(MACROSDIR)`
- [x] Macro directory is correctly passed to `mdpp.py`
- [x] Builds expand macros correctly for all formats
- [x] No missing macro errors in output

## Implementation Notes

- Updated all Makefiles to use the new argument
- Improved error messages for missing macros
- Validated builds for slides, posts, notes, etc.
