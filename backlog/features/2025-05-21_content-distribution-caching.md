# Task: Content Distribution and Caching

## Description

The system currently uses multiple mechanisms for content distribution and caching:

1. *Direct Downloads via wget*
   - Macro files downloaded from GitHub raw content
   - Citation processor YAML from inverseprobability.com
   - Managed in makefiles (make-macros.mk, make-lists.mk)

2. *Git-based Updates*
   - Local caches of centrally stored variables
   - Managed through maketalk.py
   - Used for people information, teaching lists, etc.

This leads to several problems:
- Inconsistent mechanisms for content distribution
- No clear versioning strategy
- Potential for stale content
- No offline-first capability
- No clear separation between content and code
- Multiple sources of truth for similar content

## Data-Oriented Architecture Approach

We will leverage the Data-Oriented Architecture (DOA) principles as implemented in the lynguine package to create a standardized approach to content distribution and caching. The three core DOA principles will guide our implementation:

1. *Data as First-Class Citizen*
   - Create a unified content model with consistent file formats and schemas
   - Implement shared data model across components using lynguine's access.io module
   - Replace API/RPC approaches with data coupling via content repositories 
   - Store content metadata for tracking, monitoring, and versioning

2. *Prioritize Decentralization*
   - Enable local-first content access using lynguine's FileDownloader and caching mechanisms
   - Implement partial replication of content repositories based on usage patterns
   - Support peer-to-peer sharing of content between collaborating instances
   - Store content chunks locally with automatic synchronization

3. *Openness*
   - Implement autonomous content acquisition through lynguine's download module
   - Use asynchronous content updates that don't block content consumption
   - Develop a standard message exchange protocol for content distribution

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create CIP-0005: Content Distribution and Caching
- [ ] Define standard format for content packages leveraging lynguine's IO capabilities
- [ ] Design versioning strategy with content metadata
- [ ] Implement offline-first capabilities using lynguine's FileDownloader and GitDownloader
- [ ] Create a content registry for tracking available content resources
- [ ] Implement automated content synchronization with conflict resolution
- [ ] Develop peer-to-peer content sharing mechanism 
- [ ] Migrate existing content to new system
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new approach
- [ ] Add tests for content distribution and caching

## Implementation Notes

The implementation will use lynguine's data-oriented framework to create a content distribution system with the following components:

1. *Content Package Format*
   - Define a standard YAML schema for content metadata
   - Support multiple content formats (markdown, YAML, JSON, etc.)
   - Include provenance information for tracking and attribution

2. *Content Registry*
   - Create a central registry for discovering available content
   - Implement using lynguine's access.io module for data access
   - Track versions, dependencies, and update schedules

3. *Decentralized Storage*
   - Use lynguine's FileDownloader for caching content locally
   - Implement content chunk storage with partial replication
   - Support offline use with local-first approach

4. *Content Synchronization Protocol*
   - Define a standard message format for content updates
   - Implement asynchronous update mechanisms
   - Handle conflict resolution for concurrent updates

5. *Migration Strategy*
   - Replace wget downloads with lynguine FileDownloader
   - Convert git-based updates to use GitDownloader with robust caching
   - Standardize metadata across all content types
