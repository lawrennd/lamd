# Task: Refactor mdpp.py for Improved Testability and Coverage

## Description

The `mdpp.py` script is currently structured as a standalone script, which makes it difficult to test and measure coverage effectively. This refactoring aims to restructure `mdpp.py` into a proper module, allowing for better testability and coverage tracking.

## Goals

- Restructure `mdpp.py` to expose its functions at the module level.
- Ensure all functions are importable and testable.
- Improve coverage measurement for the module.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `mdpp.py` is refactored to expose all functions at the module level.
- [ ] All functions are importable and can be tested directly.
- [ ] Coverage for `mdpp.py` is measured and reported correctly.
- [ ] Existing functionality remains unchanged.

## Implementation Notes

- Move code from the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block into separate functions.
- Ensure all functions are documented and have appropriate docstrings.
- Update tests to import and test functions directly.
