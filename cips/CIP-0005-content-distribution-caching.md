# CIP-0005: Data-Oriented Content Distribution and Caching

## Abstract

This CIP proposes a standardized approach to content distribution and caching in the lamd system using Data-Oriented Architecture (DOA) principles implemented through the lynguine package. The proposal addresses the current inconsistencies in content management by treating content as a first-class citizen, prioritizing decentralization, and creating an open architecture for content distribution.

## Motivation

The current lamd system uses multiple inconsistent mechanisms for content distribution and caching:

1. Direct downloads via wget, managed in makefiles
2. Git-based updates, managed through Python scripts

These inconsistencies lead to several problems:
- No clear versioning strategy
- Potential for stale content
- No offline-first capability
- No clear separation between content and code
- Multiple sources of truth for similar content

By adopting a DOA approach, we can address these issues while providing a more robust, flexible, and maintainable content distribution system.

## Specification

### 1. Content Package Format

All content will be distributed as standardized content packages with the following structure:

```
content_id/
├── metadata.yaml  # Content metadata
├── main_file      # Primary content file
└── ...            # Additional content files
```

#### 1.1 Content Metadata Schema

The `metadata.yaml` file must include the following fields:

```yaml
id: "unique_content_id"
type: "file|git|directory"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Brief description of the content"
url: "https://origin.url/path"
license: "License information"
citation: "Attribution information"
main_file: "primary_file_name"
dependencies: []  # Other content IDs this content depends on
last_updated: "ISO-8601 timestamp"
size: "size in human-readable format"
```

### 2. Content Registry

A central content registry will track all available content resources. The registry will be stored as a YAML file at `~/.lamd/content_registry.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
content_resources:
  content_id_1:
    type: "file"
    url: "https://example.com/content1.yaml"
    description: "Example content 1"
    version: "1.0.0"
    # Additional metadata...
  content_id_2:
    type: "git"
    url: "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
    description: "Example git repository"
    version: "1.0.0"
    # Additional metadata...
```

### 3. Data-Oriented Architecture Implementation

The implementation follows the three DOA principles:

#### 3.1 Data as First-Class Citizen

- Content is treated as a first-class entity with its own lifecycle
- All content has standardized metadata
- Content state changes are tracked explicitly
- Content dependencies are declared explicitly
- lynguine's access.io module is used for unified data access

#### 3.2 Prioritize Decentralization

- Content is cached locally in `~/.lamd/cache/`
- Content can be accessed offline after initial download
- Content synchronization happens on-demand
- Content can be shared directly between peers
- lynguine's FileDownloader and GitDownloader handle different content types

#### 3.3 Openness

- Content updates are asynchronous
- Components publish and subscribe to content updates
- New content sources can be added dynamically
- Standard message exchange protocol for content updates
- Content state is observable through the content registry

### 4. Content Synchronization Protocol

Content updates are distributed using a message-based protocol with the following message format:

```json
{
  "content_id": "unique_content_id",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-22T10:15:00Z",
  "message": "Update description",
  "changes": [
    {
      "file": "filename",
      "operation": "add|modify|delete"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Migration Plan

The migration from the current system to the new DOA-based approach will happen in phases:

1. Create the content registry with metadata for all existing content
2. Replace wget downloads with lynguine FileDownloader
3. Convert git-based updates to use GitDownloader
4. Update makefiles to use the new content distribution system
5. Add validation for content integrity
6. Implement peer-to-peer content sharing

## Rationale

A DOA-based approach is ideal for content distribution for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Treats content separate from code, making both easier to maintain.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through data, reducing tight interdependencies.
3. **Transparency**: Content state changes are explicit and traceable.
4. **Flexibility**: New content types can be added without changing the core system.
5. **Resilience**: Local caching and decentralization provide offline capabilities and fault tolerance.

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation will maintain backward compatibility by:

1. Preserving the existing file locations and formats
2. Creating wrapper functions that map old API calls to new ones
3. Adding compatibility layers in makefiles
4. Supporting both the old and new approaches during transition

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is provided in the `content_distribution.py` script, which demonstrates:

1. ContentRegistry for content metadata management
2. ContentDistributor for handling content downloads and local caching
3. ContentSynchronizer for managing content updates
4. Integration with the lynguine package for data access and downloading

## Security Considerations

The DOA-based content distribution system introduces several security considerations:

1. **Content Validation**: Verify content integrity using checksums
2. **Permission Management**: Control access to sensitive content
3. **Update Authentication**: Ensure updates come from authorized sources
4. **Data Privacy**: Protect personal information in content
5. **Local Storage Security**: Secure locally cached content
