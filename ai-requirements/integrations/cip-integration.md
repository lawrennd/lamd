# Integrating Requirements with CIPs

This guide explains how to connect the AI-Assisted Requirements Framework with VibeSafe's Code Improvement Plans (CIPs) system.

## Overview

The Requirements Framework and CIP system are complementary:

- *Requirements Framework*: Focuses on gathering, refining, and validating user needs
- *CIP System*: Focuses on proposing, documenting, and implementing code improvements

By connecting these systems, you create traceability from user needs to implementation decisions, ensuring that code improvements are aligned with actual requirements.

## Integration Process

### 1. From Requirements to CIPs

When requirements are mature enough to warrant implementation planning:

1. Identify which requirements need significant design or architectural decisions
2. Create a CIP for each major feature or component
3. Reference specific requirements documents in the CIP's "Motivation" section
4. Include key acceptance criteria from requirements in the CIP's "Testing Strategy"
5. Update the requirements document with a link to the associated CIP

#### Example CIP Template Addition

```markdown
## Related Requirements

This CIP addresses the following requirements:

- [Link to requirements document 1]
- [Link to requirements document 2]

Specifically, it implements solutions for:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]
```

### 2. From CIPs to Requirements

When CIPs lead to new or revised requirements:

1. Document the new requirements using the requirements framework
2. Link back to the originating CIP
3. Validate the requirements with stakeholders
4. Update the CIP to reference the new requirements documents

### 3. Implementation Status Tracking

Use both systems to track implementation status:

1. CIP's "Implementation Status" section tracks technical progress
2. Requirements document maintains "Implementation Status" section for stakeholder communication
3. Cross-reference between the two to maintain alignment

#### Example Requirements Status Addition

```markdown
## Implementation Status

The requirements in this document are being addressed as follows:

| Requirement | Implementation Status | CIP Reference |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| User Authentication | In Progress | [CIP-0005](../../cip/cip0005.md) |
| Data Export | Ready (Not Started) | [CIP-0007](../../cip/cip0007.md) |
| Report Generation | Completed | [CIP-0003](../../cip/cip0003.md) |
```

## Maintaining Requirements-CIP Alignment

To ensure ongoing alignment between requirements and CIPs:

1. *Requirements Update Process*:
   - When requirements change, identify affected CIPs
   - Update CIPs or create new ones as needed
   - Document the rationale for changes

2. *CIP Update Process*:
   - When CIP implementation approaches change, assess impact on requirements
   - Update requirements if the changes affect user-visible behavior
   - Get stakeholder sign-off on significant changes

3. *Integration Review*:
   - Periodically review the alignment between requirements and CIPs
   - Address any disconnects or misalignments
   - Update cross-references to maintain traceability

## Tools for Requirements-CIP Integration

### 1. Bi-directional Linking

Maintain explicit links between requirements and CIPs in both directions:

- Requirements documents link to relevant CIPs
- CIPs link back to source requirements

### 2. Traceability Matrix

Create a traceability matrix to visualize the relationships:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | CIP Reference | Implementation Status |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| REQ-001 | User login via OAuth | CIP-0005 | In Progress |
| REQ-002 | Data export to CSV | CIP-0007 | Ready |
| REQ-003 | Weekly report generation | CIP-0003 | Completed |

### 3. Status Synchronization

Develop a consistent approach to status updates:

- Define how status changes in one system affect the other
- Establish who is responsible for maintaining alignment
- Create a schedule for alignment checks

## Example Integration Workflow

1. *Requirements Discovery*:
   - Conduct requirements conversations with stakeholders
   - Document requirements using the framework
   - Validate requirements with stakeholders

2. *CIP Creation*:
   - Create CIPs based on validated requirements
   - Reference requirements explicitly in CIPs
   - Update requirements with CIP references

3. *Implementation*:
   - Follow the CIP process for implementation
   - Update both CIP and requirements status as progress occurs
   - Address any requirement changes through formal updates

4. *Validation and Closure*:
   - Validate implementation against original requirements
   - Update both requirements and CIP status to "Completed"
   - Document any deviations or future enhancements

## Best Practices

1. *Be Explicit About Connections*: Always maintain clear references between requirements and CIPs
2. *Keep Documentation Updated*: Update both systems when changes occur
3. *Involve Stakeholders*: Ensure stakeholders understand both requirements and implementation plans
4. *Balance Detail*: Requirements should focus on "what" and "why", CIPs on "how" and "when"
5. *Address Gaps Promptly*: When disconnects are identified, address them immediately
