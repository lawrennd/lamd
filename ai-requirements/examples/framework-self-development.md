# Dogfooding Example: Using the AI-Requirements Framework for Its Own Development

This document demonstrates how we use the AI-Requirements framework to plan and manage its own further development - a self-referential example of "dogfooding" our own tools.

## Initial Requirements Conversation

```
# Requirements Discovery Conversation

## Project Context

I'm looking to further develop the AI-Requirements Framework for VibeSafe that we've implemented in Phase 1. We need to plan Phase 2 and beyond in a way that uses our own tools to demonstrate their effectiveness.

The main goals of this project are:
1. Complete the implementation of the framework outlined in CIP-0009
2. Demonstrate the framework's practicality by using it for its own development
3. Create a compelling example of "dogfooding" for VibeSafe users
4. Identify gaps or issues in the framework through actual use

I anticipate this framework will be used by software development teams who need to bridge the gap between natural language requirements and implementation, especially those working with AI assistance.

## Current Situation

Currently, we have implemented Phase 1 of the framework, which includes:
- Basic directory structure and documentation
- Initial prompt templates for discovery, refinement, validation, and testing
- One conversation pattern for stakeholder identification
- One example for web application discovery
- Integration guidelines for CIPs

The main challenges or pain points are:
1. Need more examples to demonstrate the framework's versatility
2. Need better integration with backlog system
3. Missing Cursor rules for seamless IDE integration
4. Need project templates that include requirements components
5. Need to fill out remaining conversation patterns

## Initial Requirements

I think the next phase of development should:
1. Create complete examples for all prompt types
2. Implement backlog integration similar to CIP integration
3. Develop Cursor rules for requirements conversations
4. Create project templates with requirements components
5. Add more conversation patterns beyond stakeholder identification
6. Develop validation tools or checklists for requirements quality

## Constraints and Assumptions

Some important constraints to consider:
1. We need to maintain consistency with existing VibeSafe components
2. The implementation should follow VibeSafe's tenets (user autonomy, simplicity, etc.)
3. We need to focus on practical utility over theoretical perfection
4. Examples should be realistic and applicable to real-world scenarios

I'm making these assumptions:
1. Users will have varying levels of requirements gathering experience
2. The framework will be used with different types of AI assistants
3. Requirements will need to flow into both CIPs and backlog items

## Questions

I'm particularly unsure about:
1. How should we structure the backlog integration compared to CIP integration?
2. What additional conversation patterns would be most valuable to implement next?
3. How can we best validate that the requirements framework is effective?

Can you help me explore these requirements further and identify what I might be missing?
```

## AI Response

I'll help you explore requirements for further developing the AI-Requirements Framework while using it as a self-referential example of dogfooding.

### Requirements Analysis

Your goals and initial requirements provide a solid direction for Phase 2. Let's explore additional considerations:

#### Core Functionality Considerations

**Examples & Templates**:
- Consider having examples for different domains (web apps, data science, embedded systems)
- Ensure examples show the full lifecycle from requirements to implementation
- Include templates for specific industries with specialized requirements (healthcare, finance, etc.)
- Add templates for non-functional requirements (security, performance, accessibility)

**Backlog Integration**:
- Consider the different granularity between CIPs and backlog items
- Need to determine how to link high-level requirements to specific tasks
- Address prioritization and estimation for backlog items derived from requirements
- Define a schema for requirements metadata in backlog items

**Conversation Patterns**:
- Beyond stakeholder identification, consider patterns for:
  - Goal decomposition (breaking high-level goals into requirements)
  - Constraint exploration (identifying technical, business, and regulatory constraints)
  - Priority setting (methods to prioritize competing requirements)
  - Risk identification (identifying potential risks in requirements)
  - Acceptance criteria definition (defining clear success criteria)

**Validation Tools**:
- Consider checklists for different types of systems
- Create heuristic evaluation guides for requirements quality
- Design tools to identify missing requirements categories
- Develop metrics for requirements completeness and clarity

#### Integration Considerations

**Cursor Rules Integration**:
- How to make Cursor aware of requirements documents
- Auto-completion or templates for requirements in Cursor
- Navigation between requirements and related code
- Visualization of requirements coverage in code

**Project Template Integration**:
- How to integrate requirements into different project types
- Initial setup scripts to configure requirements structures
- Documentation on adapting templates to specific projects
- Migration paths for existing projects

#### Dogfooding Opportunities

Since you're dogfooding the framework, consider documenting:

1. **Meta-requirements process**: Document how you're using the framework to develop itself
2. **Requirement evolution**: Track how requirements change based on implementation insights
3. **Self-healing**: How using the framework reveals improvements to the framework itself
4. **Integration points**: Where requirements for the framework connect to its own implementation

### Addressing Your Specific Questions

**1. How should we structure the backlog integration compared to CIP integration?**

While CIP integration focuses on larger architectural decisions, backlog integration should:

- Be more granular and task-focused
- Include estimations and prioritization mechanisms
- Support direct creation of tasks from requirements
- Maintain bidirectional traceability (requirements to tasks and vice versa)
- Include templated task descriptions derived from requirements
- Support requirement status updates when related tasks change

I recommend a structure similar to:
```
ai-requirements/
├── integrations/
│   ├── cip-integration.md         # Existing CIP integration
│   ├── backlog-integration.md     # New backlog integration
│   ├── common/                    # Shared components
│   │   ├── traceability.md        # Common traceability mechanisms
│   │   └── status-sync.md         # Status synchronization between systems
```

**2. What additional conversation patterns would be most valuable to implement next?**

Based on common requirements challenges, I recommend:

1. **Goal Decomposition Pattern**: Techniques for breaking high-level goals into specific, actionable requirements
2. **Constraint Mapping Pattern**: Systematically identifying all constraints (technical, business, legal, etc.)
3. **Priority Setting Pattern**: Structured approaches to prioritize competing requirements
4. **Non-Functional Requirements Pattern**: Ensuring coverage of performance, security, usability, etc.
5. **Scenario Exploration Pattern**: Developing user scenarios to validate requirements completeness

**3. How can we best validate that the requirements framework is effective?**

Multiple validation approaches would be valuable:

1. **Self-referential metrics**: Document how the framework improves its own development
2. **Case studies**: Apply the framework to other VibeSafe components and document outcomes
3. **Before/after analysis**: Compare requirements quality before and after framework adoption
4. **User feedback mechanisms**: Structured ways to collect feedback on framework effectiveness
5. **Implementation traceability**: Measure how well implementations match original requirements
6. **Iteration efficiency**: Measure improvements in requirements iteration cycles
7. **Stakeholder satisfaction**: Survey stakeholders on requirements clarity and completeness

### Additional Stakeholders to Consider

- **Framework Users**: Developers who will use the requirements framework
- **Non-Technical Stakeholders**: Who will participate in requirements conversations
- **AI System Designers**: Who create the AI systems that will interact with the framework
- **Documentation Specialists**: Who will use the framework to document requirements
- **Project Managers**: Who need to connect requirements to project planning

### Potential Phase 2 Scope

Based on your constraints and goals, here's a suggested scope for Phase 2:

**Must-Have**:
- Complete examples for all prompt types (refinement, validation, testing)
- Backlog integration documentation and templates
- One additional conversation pattern (goal decomposition)
- Basic Cursor rules for requirements documents

**Should-Have**:
- Two more conversation patterns (constraint mapping, priority setting)
- Project templates with requirements components
- Simple validation checklists for requirements quality
- Self-assessment metrics for framework effectiveness

**Future Phases**:
- Advanced validation tools
- Domain-specific templates
- Comprehensive pattern library
- AI-specific guidance for different models and capabilities
- Visual requirements mapping tools

### Next Steps

1. **Create a backlog entry** for each major Phase 2 component using the framework itself
2. **Develop requirements refinement documents** for the most critical components
3. **Use the stakeholder identification pattern** to map stakeholders for each component
4. **Create validation criteria** that will be used to evaluate the framework's effectiveness
5. **Establish metrics** to track the framework's impact on its own development

This approach demonstrates the framework's practical utility while ensuring its continued development meets real-world needs.

## Next Actions

Based on this requirements exploration, our next actions should be:

1. Create specific backlog items for each Phase 2 component (first one created on 2025-05-08)
2. Develop the backlog integration documentation next
3. Implement additional examples showing the full requirements lifecycle
4. Create the Goal Decomposition conversation pattern
5. Develop initial Cursor rules for requirements documents

## Integration with VibeSafe

This self-referential requirements work connects to:

- **CIP-0009**: Implementing the next phases outlined in the CIP
- **Backlog**: Creating specific tasks from these requirements
- **Tenets**: Demonstrating VibeSafe's "dogfooding" approach in practice
