# Example: Creating Backlog Items from Requirements

This example demonstrates the process of translating requirements from a requirements conversation into specific backlog items.

## 1. Initial Requirements Conversation

From a requirements discovery conversation with the AI-Requirements Framework maintainer:

```
# Requirements Discovery Conversation

## Project Context

I'm looking to enhance the AI-Requirements Framework with better validation tools. The main goals are:

1. Help users validate that their requirements are complete and high-quality
2. Provide automated checks for common requirements issues
3. Make it easier to spot missing or incomplete requirements

This will be used by software development teams who want to ensure their requirements are clear, complete, and actionable before implementation.

## Current Situation

Currently, the framework has basic validation guidance in the form of prompts, but no structured tools or checklists to help users validate requirements quality systematically.

The main challenges are:
1. Requirements often miss important categories (e.g., error handling, edge cases)
2. Validation is manual and inconsistent
3. Users don't have clear criteria for what makes a "good" requirement

## Initial Requirements

I think we need to develop:

1. A comprehensive requirements quality checklist
2. A validation tool that can be run against requirements documents
3. Example templates of well-validated requirements
4. Integration with the existing requirements workflow

## Constraints and Assumptions

Some important constraints:
1. Tools should work with plain Markdown files
2. We need to maintain compatibility with the existing framework
3. The solution should be language-agnostic
4. Implementation should follow VibeSafe tenets

I'm assuming:
1. Users have varying levels of experience with requirements
2. The validation should be usable with or without AI assistance
3. We'll need both automated and manual validation components

## Questions

I'm particularly unsure about:
1. How much automation is realistic for validating natural language requirements?
2. What are the most common quality issues we should check for?
3. How should validation results be presented to users?
```

## 2. Requirements Refinement

After analysis and refinement, the following core requirements were identified:

1. **Validation Checklist**: Develop a comprehensive requirements quality checklist covering completeness, clarity, testability, and feasibility
2. **Automated Validation Tool**: Create a script to validate requirements documents for common issues
3. **Integration**: Integrate validation into the existing requirements workflow
4. **Templates**: Provide example templates of well-validated requirements
5. **Documentation**: Create user documentation on requirements validation

## 3. Breaking Down into Backlog Items

These requirements can be broken down into the following backlog items:

### Backlog Item 1: Requirements Validation Checklist

```markdown
# Task: Create Comprehensive Requirements Validation Checklist

## Metadata
- **ID**: 2025-05-08_requirements-validation-checklist
- **Type**: Feature
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0009, ai-requirements foundation

## Requirements Reference

This task implements the following requirements:
- [Requirements Validation Enhancement](../../ai-requirements/examples/validation-requirements.md)

Specifically, it addresses:
- "Develop a comprehensive requirements quality checklist covering completeness, clarity, testability, and feasibility"

## Description

Create a comprehensive, reusable validation checklist that helps users assess the quality of their requirements. The checklist should cover key aspects of requirements quality and provide clear criteria for evaluation.

## Detailed Tasks

1. Research existing requirements validation frameworks and best practices
2. Create a structured checklist organized by quality categories:
   - Completeness (covering all necessary aspects)
   - Clarity (unambiguous, understandable language)
   - Testability (verifiable through testing)
   - Feasibility (technically and practically possible)
   - Consistency (no contradictions between requirements)
3. Include examples of good and poor requirements for each criterion
4. Create a markdown-based scorecard template for evaluating requirements
5. Test the checklist against existing requirements documents

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Checklist covers at least 20 specific validation criteria across all quality categories
2. Each criterion has a clear description and examples
3. Checklist is provided in markdown format
4. Checklist includes guidance on remediation for common issues
5. Checklist has been tested on at least two real requirements documents

## Estimation Rationale

This task is estimated as Medium effort because:
- It requires research into best practices
- Creating quality examples will take significant time
- Testing and refinement will be needed
- The output needs to be comprehensive yet usable

## Prioritization Rationale

This task is High priority because:
- It provides the foundation for all other validation work
- It delivers immediate value even before automation
- Other tasks depend on the criteria defined here
```

### Backlog Item 2: Automated Validation Tool

```markdown
# Task: Implement Requirements Validation Script

## Metadata
- **ID**: 2025-05-08_requirements-validation-script
- **Type**: Feature
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: Large
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Dependencies**: 2025-05-08_requirements-validation-checklist

## Requirements Reference

This task implements the following requirements:
- [Requirements Validation Enhancement](../../ai-requirements/examples/validation-requirements.md)

Specifically, it addresses:
- "Create a script to validate requirements documents for common issues"

## Description

Develop a Python script that can automatically validate requirements documents against common quality issues. The script should analyze markdown files, identify potential problems, and generate a report with improvement suggestions.

## Detailed Tasks

1. Create a Python script structure that can parse markdown requirements documents
2. Implement checks for common issues identified in the validation checklist:
   - Missing sections
   - Vague language detection
   - Inconsistent terminology
   - Lack of acceptance criteria
   - Unbounded requirements (missing constraints)
3. Generate a readable report highlighting issues and suggesting improvements
4. Add configuration options to customize validation rules
5. Include examples showing usage patterns
6. Create tests for the validation script

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Script successfully analyzes markdown requirements documents
2. At least 10 automated validation checks are implemented
3. Output report clearly identifies issues and their locations
4. Script can be run from command line with configuration options
5. Documentation includes usage examples
6. Tests verify correct functioning of all validation checks

## Estimation Rationale

This task is estimated as Large effort because:
- Building a robust markdown parser requires care
- Implementing natural language analysis is complex
- Creating meaningful suggestions is challenging
- Comprehensive testing will be needed
- Documentation needs to be clear and complete

## Prioritization Rationale

This task is Medium priority because:
- It depends on the validation checklist being completed first
- The manual checklist provides value while this is being developed
- Automation provides scaling benefits for larger requirements sets
```

### Backlog Item 3: Integration with Requirements Workflow

```markdown
# Task: Integrate Validation into Requirements Workflow

## Metadata
- **ID**: 2025-05-08_validation-workflow-integration
- **Type**: Feature
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: Small
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Dependencies**: 2025-05-08_requirements-validation-checklist

## Requirements Reference

This task implements the following requirements:
- [Requirements Validation Enhancement](../../ai-requirements/examples/validation-requirements.md)

Specifically, it addresses:
- "Integrate validation into the existing requirements workflow"

## Description

Update the AI-Requirements framework documentation and process to incorporate validation as a standard step in the requirements workflow. This should seamlessly connect requirements creation, validation, and implementation planning.

## Detailed Tasks

1. Update the AI-Requirements README.md to include validation as a core component
2. Create ai-requirements/integrations/validation-integration.md explaining how validation fits into the workflow
3. Add validation steps to existing prompts (particularly refinement and testing)
4. Update example conversation flow diagrams to include validation steps
5. Add validation status tracking to requirements templates

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation clearly explains when and how to validate requirements
2. Validation is seamlessly integrated into the existing workflow
3. Examples demonstrate the updated workflow including validation
4. Templates include fields for tracking validation status
5. Integration maintains compatibility with CIP and backlog integrations

## Estimation Rationale

This task is estimated as Small effort because:
- It primarily involves documentation updates
- No complex implementation is required
- It builds on existing workflow components
- Much of the content comes from completed validation tasks

## Prioritization Rationale

This task is Medium priority because:
- It can be started after the validation checklist is complete
- It's needed before users can effectively adopt validation
- It provides the connective tissue between validation and the rest of the framework
```
