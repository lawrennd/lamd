# Example: Goal Decomposition for Data Analytics Dashboard

This document demonstrates the application of the Goal Decomposition Pattern to a data analytics dashboard project.

## Initial High-Level Goal

```
Create a data analytics dashboard that enables business users to gain actionable insights from company data without requiring technical expertise.
```

## Goal Decomposition Process

### 1. Goal Clarification

**Questions and Answers:**

Q: "What specific problem or opportunity does this goal address?"
A: "Business users currently struggle to access and interpret company data which is siloed across systems and requires technical skills to extract and analyze."

Q: "How would you measure success for this goal?"
A: "Success would be measured by: increased number of business users accessing data insights regularly (target: 80% of target users weekly), reduced time to obtain insights (target: from days to minutes), and business decisions informed by data (target: 50% increase in data-driven decisions)."

Q: "Who are the primary beneficiaries when this goal is achieved?"
A: "Marketing analysts, sales managers, product managers, and executive leadership who need data insights but lack data science expertise."

Q: "Are there any constraints or boundaries that should limit the scope of this goal?"
A: "The solution should work with existing data sources, comply with company security policies, and be implementable within 4 months."

Q: "How does this goal align with broader strategic objectives?"
A: "This aligns with our strategic initiative to become a more data-driven organization and to democratize access to insights across departments."

### 5. Verification Mapping

**Mapping Requirements to Original Goal:**

| Requirement Category | Contribution to Original Goal |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Visualization | Enables non-technical users to interpret complex data through visual representations |
| Data Access & Integration | Removes technical barriers to accessing data across silos |
| Analysis Tools | Provides guided paths to insights without requiring technical expertise |
| Sharing & Collaboration | Allows insights to be communicated and acted upon across the organization |
| Self-Service Tools | Empowers users to create their own insights without developer dependency |

### 6. Gap Analysis

**Identified Gaps:**

1. **Training & Adoption** - The requirements don't address how users will learn to use the system.
   - Add requirements for in-app tutorials and education resources.
   - Include user onboarding workflows.

2. **Data Literacy** - Users may struggle to interpret data correctly even with visualizations.
   - Add requirements for embedded explanations of statistical concepts.
   - Include data interpretation guides within analysis tools.

3. **Integration with Decision Processes** - The system enables insights but doesn't connect to action workflows.
   - Add requirements for integration with action systems (e.g., task management, project tools).
   - Include features to track decisions made based on insights.

4. **Data Governance** - Requirements for maintaining data quality and compliance need strengthening.
   - Add explicit requirements for data lineage tracking.
   - Include permission controls for sensitive data.

### 7. Priority Alignment

**Priority Matrix:**

| Requirement Category | Priority | Rationale |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| Data Visualization | High | Core to enabling non-technical users to understand data |
| Data Access & Integration | High | Essential to accessing siloed data without technical skills |
| Analysis Tools | Medium | Important but can be phased in with basic templates first |
| Sharing & Collaboration | Medium | Valuable but can be enhanced after core functionality |

## Conclusion

Through the goal decomposition process, we transformed a single high-level goal into 25 specific, actionable requirements organized into a coherent structure. The requirements directly support the original goal while addressing the needs of different user groups. The priority alignment helps guide implementation planning, ensuring the most critical aspects are delivered first.

This example demonstrates how the Goal Decomposition Pattern helps ensure that requirements are comprehensive, aligned with objectives, and properly prioritized for implementation.
