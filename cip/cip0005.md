# CIP-0005: Improve mdpp Error Handling and Validation

## Summary

This CIP proposes to enhance the mdpp command's error handling and validation capabilities to provide better debugging support and prevent cryptic errors when processing markdown files.

## Motivation

Currently, mdpp passes arguments directly to gpp without thorough validation, which can lead to:
1. Cryptic error messages when gpp fails
2. Difficult debugging of preprocessing issues
3. Lack of clear feedback about missing dependencies or incorrect arguments
4. No validation of file paths and includes before processing

## Detailed Description

We propose to enhance mdpp with the following improvements:

1. *Pre-processing Validation*:
   - Validate all file paths before processing
   - Check for existence of required include files
   - Verify format and output options are valid
   - Validate snippets path and other directory references

2. *Enhanced Error Messages*:
   - Provide clear, actionable error messages
   - Include context about where errors occur
   - Suggest potential fixes for common issues
   - Log validation steps for debugging

3. *Argument Processing*:
   - Add verbose mode for detailed processing information
   - Validate gpp arguments before passing them
   - Check for common syntax issues in markdown files
   - Provide warnings for deprecated or problematic options

4. *Dependency Checking*:
   - Verify required tools are installed and accessible
   - Check version compatibility of dependencies
   - Validate template and include paths
   - Ensure bibliography files exist when referenced

## Implementation Plan

1. *Phase 1: Basic Validation* (Complete)
   - Added file and directory validation to mdpp.py
   - Created lamd/validation.py for reusable validation functions
   - Fixed shell quoting for gpp arguments in mdpp.py
   - Improved error messages for missing files and invalid arguments
   - All existing tests pass and mdpp now runs without shell quoting errors

2. *Phase 2: Enhanced Error Handling* (Complete)
   - Implemented detailed error messages with context
   - Added verbose mode for detailed processing information
   - Simplified error handling using print statements
   - Improved error reporting for validation and unexpected errors

3. *Phase 3: Directory Argument Handling and Macro Path Robustness* (Complete)
   - Standardized directory argument handling across all Makefiles and scripts
   - Updated all Makefiles to use --macros-path and ensured correct macro expansion
   - Improved validation utilities to support colon-separated lists and better error messages
   - Ensured robust handling of macro, snippet, and diagram directories in mdpp.py
   - Improved robustness and debug output handling in copy_web_diagrams.sh

4. *Phase 4: Dependency Management* (In Progress)
   - Add dependency checking
   - Implement version validation
   - Create dependency resolution system
   - Add automatic dependency installation option

5. *Phase 5: Testing and Documentation* (In Progress)
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Create user documentation
   - Add debugging guide
   - Create troubleshooting section

6. *Phase 6: Directory System and mdfield Priority* (Complete)
   - Fixed critical bug in mdfield priority logic (markdown vs config file priority)
   - Enhanced practical directory system with conditional copying
   - Created comprehensive test suite for entire directory system
   - All layout types and directory extractions now properly tested
   - Fixed practical files not being copied to correct directories

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain backward compatibility by:
1. Keeping existing command-line interface
2. Preserving current functionality
3. Making new features optional
4. Providing fallback behavior for existing usage

## Testing Strategy

1. *Unit Tests*:
   - Test each validation function
   - Verify error message generation
   - Check dependency validation
   - Test argument processing

2. *Integration Tests*:
   - Test with real markdown files
   - Verify include file handling
   - Check template processing
   - Test bibliography handling

3. *Error Case Testing*:
   - Test missing file scenarios
   - Verify invalid argument handling
   - Check dependency error cases
   - Test syntax error detection

## Related Work

During the analysis of mdpp error handling, we identified a broader need for standardized content distribution and caching. This work has been moved to a separate backlog item (2025-05-21_content-distribution-caching.md) to be addressed after the completion of this CIP.
