# CIP-0002: Systematic Requirements Gathering for lamd

## Summary
This CIP proposes to establish a systematic process for gathering, documenting, and tracking requirements for the lamd project by analyzing existing repositories where lamd is used. The goal is to better understand usage patterns, extract implicit requirements, and ensure that the project evolves in alignment with actual academic content creation needs.

## Motivation
The lamd project has evolved organically to support academic content creation, but currently lacks a structured approach to gathering and managing requirements. This has led to:

1. Uncertainty about which features are most important to users
2. Potential gaps between implemented functionality and actual needs
3. Ad-hoc feature implementation without clear prioritization
4. Difficulty in planning future development roadmaps
5. Limited visibility into how the tools are actually utilized

A systematic requirements gathering process focused on analyzing existing repositories will help address these issues and provide a foundation for more focused development efforts.

## Detailed Description

We propose to establish a requirements gathering framework focused on analyzing repositories that use lamd:

1. *Repository Analysis*: Analyze ~/lawrennd/talks, ~/lawrennd/cv, ~/lawrennd/snippets, and ~/mlatcl/advds repositories to understand how lamd is being used in practice.

2. *Usage Pattern Documentation*: Create detailed descriptions of common use cases and workflows based on repository analysis.

3. *Implicit Requirements Extraction*: Identify implicit requirements and expectations by examining how content is structured and processed.

4. *Requirements Categorization*: Establish a framework for categorizing requirements as functional, non-functional, and constraints.

5. *Prioritization Framework*: Implement a consistent method for evaluating and prioritizing requirements.

6. *Traceability Matrix*: Create a system to trace requirements to implementations and tests.

7. *Feedback Collection System*: Establish mechanisms for ongoing feedback collection and integration based on real usage.

## Implementation Plan

1. *Design Repository Analysis Methodology*:
   - Create a structured approach for analyzing repositories
   - Define metrics and patterns to look for
   - Develop tools to automate parts of the analysis

2. *Conduct Repository Analysis*:
   - Analyze ~/lawrennd/talks repository for talk content patterns
   - Analyze ~/lawrennd/cv repository for CV generation patterns
   - Analyze ~/lawrennd/snippets repository for content reuse patterns
   - Analyze ~/mlatcl/advds repository for educational content patterns

3. *Analyze Results*:
   - Identify common patterns and workflows
   - Extract implicit requirements
   - Document edge cases and special usage patterns

4. *Create Requirements Framework*:
   - Establish categories and templates for requirements documentation
   - Set up a system for requirements management
   - Define prioritization criteria based on observed usage frequency

5. *Document Initial Requirements*:
   - Create detailed requirements based on repository analysis
   - Categorize and prioritize requirements
   - Map requirements to existing functionality and gaps

6. *Integrate with Development Process*:
   - Link requirements to backlog items
   - Establish review process for new requirements
   - Create guidelines for requirements-driven development

## Backward Compatibility
The requirements gathering process itself does not affect backward compatibility. It will, however, help identify compatibility needs for future development efforts.

## Testing Strategy
1. *Analysis Validation*:
   - Cross-check findings across repositories
   - Verify that observed patterns are representative
   - Ensure analysis captures edge cases and variations

2. *Requirements Validation*:
   - Review derived requirements against actual repository usage
   - Check for clarity, completeness, and feasibility
   - Verify that requirements capture all observed patterns

3. *Process Evaluation*:
   - Assess effectiveness of requirements gathering process
   - Measure impact on development prioritization
   - Evaluate how well the derived requirements reflect actual needs

## Implementation Status
- [x] Create requirements framework - Implemented via VibeSafe installation (2026-01-03)
- [x] Document initial requirements - Requirements extracted from existing CIPs (2026-01-03)
- [x] Integrate with development process - VibeSafe provides Tenets→Requirements→CIPs→Backlog traceability (2026-01-03)
- [ ] Design repository analysis methodology - Framework exists, analysis work can be done as needed
- [ ] Conduct repository analysis - Can be done on-demand to discover new requirements
- [ ] Analyze results - Can be done on-demand to discover new requirements

## Closure Note

**Status: Closed - Implemented via VibeSafe (2026-01-03)**

This CIP proposed establishing a systematic requirements gathering process. This has been implemented through the installation of VibeSafe, which provides:

1. **Requirements Framework**: The `requirements/` directory with structured templates and YAML frontmatter for categorization, prioritization, and status tracking.

2. **Traceability System**: Clear linkage from Tenets (WHY) → Requirements (WHAT) → CIPs (HOW) → Backlog (DO), enabling tracking from principles to implementation.

3. **Documentation Process**: Templates and guidelines for documenting requirements with acceptance criteria, stakeholder identification, and progress tracking.

4. **Integration with Development**: The VibeSafe system integrates requirements with the existing CIP and backlog processes, providing the structured approach this CIP proposed.

The repository analysis work proposed in this CIP (analyzing talks, cv, snippets repos) can now be conducted using the VibeSafe framework whenever needed to discover new requirements from actual usage patterns.

Initial requirements (REQ-0001 through REQ-0004) have been extracted from existing CIPs, demonstrating the system in action.
