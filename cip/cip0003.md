# CIP-0003: Establishing Project Tenets for lamd

## Summary

This CIP proposes to establish a set of core tenets for the lamd project to guide decision-making, feature development, and overall project direction. These tenets will serve as foundational principles that reflect the project's values, priorities, and long-term vision.

## Motivation
As the lamd project continues to evolve, having a clear set of guiding principles becomes increasingly important to:

1. Provide a consistent framework for decision-making
2. Help resolve conflicts and prioritization questions
3. Communicate the project's values to new contributors and users
4. Maintain focus on what matters most to the project
5. Ensure that incremental changes align with the overall vision

Currently, the project lacks explicitly documented tenets, which can lead to inconsistent decision-making and potential drift from the original intent of the project.

## Detailed Description

We propose to establish a set of 4-6 core tenets for the lamd project. Each tenet will:

1. Express a fundamental principle or value
2. Be concise and memorable
3. Provide practical guidance for decision-making
4. Reflect the unique aspects of academic content creation
5. Address both user and developer perspectives

While the specific tenets will be developed through a collaborative process, potential areas to address include:

- *Content First*: Prioritizing the actual content over tooling complexity
- *Academic Integrity*: Supporting rigorous academic standards
- *Multi-format Flexibility*: Enabling seamless transitions between different output formats
- *Reproducibility*: Ensuring content can be reliably reproduced and shared
- *Extensibility*: Making the system adaptable to new content types and workflows
- *Accessibility*: Creating content that is accessible to diverse audiences

## Implementation Plan

1. *Research Phase*:
   - Review tenets from other successful open source projects
   - Analyze the current implicit values in lamd development
   - Gather input from core contributors and users

2. *Drafting Phase*:
   - Create initial draft tenets based on research
   - Develop explanations and examples for each tenet
   - Identify potential conflicts or trade-offs between tenets

3. *Review and Refinement*:
   - Seek feedback from the community
   - Test tenets against past decisions
   - Refine language and examples

4. *Documentation and Integration*:
   - Create formal documentation for the tenets
   - Add tenets to project README and contribution guidelines
   - Develop decision-making framework based on tenets

5. *Application and Evaluation*:
   - Apply tenets to current development decisions
   - Establish process for tenet-based evaluations of new features
   - Create mechanism for periodic review of tenets

## Backward Compatibility
Establishing tenets does not directly affect backward compatibility. However, the tenets will influence future decisions about maintaining compatibility.

## Testing Strategy
1. *Historical Application*:
   - Retrospectively apply tenets to past significant decisions
   - Evaluate whether tenets would have led to different outcomes
   - Identify edge cases or conflicts

2. *Decision-Making Scenarios*:
   - Create hypothetical scenarios to test tenet application
   - Practice using tenets in current decision contexts
   - Evaluate consistency of decisions across different decision-makers

3. *Community Validation*:
   - Gather feedback on tenet clarity and usefulness
   - Assess whether tenets resonate with the community
   - Measure alignment between tenets and community values
