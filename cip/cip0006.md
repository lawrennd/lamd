# CIP-0006: Two-Stage Command Line Interface for lamd Utilities

## Summary

This CIP proposes to refactor the command line utilities in the lamd project to use a two-stage process. The first stage generates a standardized interface file describing the inputs, outputs, and computations. The second stage executes the command using this interface file, enabling better workflow management, reproducibility, and integration with publish/subscribe services.

## Motivation

Currently, lamd command line utilities operate as single-stage commands, which can make it difficult to:
- Track and document the full workflow
- Integrate with external workflow managers or publish/subscribe systems
- Reproduce or audit computations
- Separate configuration from execution

A two-stage approach, inspired by the interface pattern in [referia](https://github.com/lawrennd/referia/blob/main/referia/config/interface.py), would improve transparency, modularity, and automation.

## Detailed Description

The proposed two-stage process is as follows:

1. *Stage 1: Interface File Generation*
   - The CLI utility generates an interface file (YAML or similar) with the following structure:
     ```
     input:
       # Specify the input files here
     output:
       # Specify the output files here
     compute:
       # Specify the computations that are done on the two
     ```
   - This file documents the workflow and can be registered with a publish/subscribe service.

2. *Stage 2: Execution*
   - The CLI utility (or a runner) reads the interface file and executes the specified computation.
   - This enables decoupling of configuration and execution, and allows for workflow orchestration.

## Implementation Plan

1. Design the interface file schema (YAML or JSON).
2. Update CLI utilities to support a `--generate-interface` or similar flag.
3. Implement logic to execute commands based on the interface file.
4. Integrate with publish/subscribe service for workflow registration.
5. Update documentation and provide usage examples.

## Backward Compatibility

- The existing single-stage CLI behavior should be preserved as a default.
- The two-stage workflow should be opt-in via a flag or subcommand.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for interface file generation and parsing.
- Integration tests for two-stage workflows.
- Tests for publish/subscribe registration.
