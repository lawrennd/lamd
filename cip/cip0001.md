# CIP-0001: lamd Command Line Utilities Documentation Improvements

## Summary
This CIP proposes to improve the documentation of all command line utilities in the lamd project. The goal is to create comprehensive, user-friendly documentation that explains the purpose, usage, options, and examples for each utility to make the toolset more accessible to users.

## Motivation
The lamd project provides several command line utilities for managing academic content, but the current documentation has several limitations:

1. Incomplete descriptions of command functionality and options
2. Lack of detailed usage examples
3. Missing information about how utilities work together in a typical workflow
4. Insufficient explanations of configuration options and their effects
5. Limited troubleshooting guidance

Improving the documentation for these utilities will make them more accessible to new users and provide a better reference for experienced users.

## Detailed Description

We propose to improve the documentation for the following command line utilities:

1. `mdpp`: Markdown preprocessor for handling macros, templates, and content formatting
2. `flags`: Extracts pandoc flags from configuration files
3. `dependencies`: Lists dependencies in markdown files
4. `mdfield`: Extracts fields from markdown headers
5. `maketalk`: Converts talk files from markdown to other formats
6. `makecv`: Converts CVs from markdown to other formats
7. `mdlist`: Generates lists from YAML definitions
8. `mdpeople`: Generates people macros from YAML definitions

For each utility, the documentation will include:

1. *Overview*: A clear explanation of the utility's purpose and common use cases
2. *Command Syntax*: Detailed documentation of all command line arguments and options
3. *Configuration*: How to configure the utility via _lamd.yml or _config.yml
4. *Examples*: Practical examples showing common usage patterns
5. *Workflow Integration*: How the utility fits into typical academic content workflows
6. *Troubleshooting*: Common issues and their solutions

## Implementation Plan

1. *Command Line Help Improvement*:
   - Update argument parser help text for all utilities
   - Add detailed descriptions for each command line option
   - Include examples in the help text where appropriate

2. *Man Page Style Documentation*:
   - Create comprehensive man page style documentation for each utility
   - Include synopsis, description, options, examples, and see also sections
   - Package these for easy access via the command line

3. *Online Documentation*:
   - Create detailed web documentation for each utility
   - Include screenshots and workflow diagrams
   - Provide copy-paste examples for common tasks

4. *README Updates*:
   - Enhance the project README with better utility descriptions
   - Add a quick reference guide for all utilities
   - Include links to detailed documentation

5. *Tutorial Creation*:
   - Develop step-by-step tutorials for common workflows
   - Create a "Getting Started" guide for new users
   - Add examples showing how utilities work together

6. *Configuration Documentation*:
   - Document all configuration options in _lamd.yml
   - Explain how configuration affects command behavior
   - Include example configuration files

## Backward Compatibility
These documentation improvements will not change the functionality of the code, ensuring full backward compatibility.

## Testing Strategy
1. *Validate Examples*:
   - Ensure all documented examples work as described
   - Test examples in different environments (Linux, macOS)
   - Verify that configuration examples are correct

2. *Documentation Review*:
   - Conduct peer reviews of documentation for accuracy and clarity
   - Have new users test documentation and provide feedback
   - Check all command line options against implementation

3. *Integration Testing*:
   - Test workflow examples end-to-end
   - Verify that the documented behavior matches the actual behavior
   - Test with real-world academic content examples

## Implementation Status
- [x] Update command line help text for `makecv` utility
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to `makecv.py`
- [x] Create and improve unit tests for `makecv`
- [x] Fix bugs in `mdpeople.py` and improve its tests
- [x] Verify documentation in other CLI utilities
- [ ] Complete updating command line help text for remaining utilities
- [ ] Create man page style documentation
- [ ] Develop online documentation
- [ ] Update project README
- [ ] Create workflow tutorials
- [ ] Document configuration options

## Progress Updates

### 2025-05-16
- Fixed a bug in `makecv.py` by adding missing `sys` import
- Created comprehensive unit tests for `makecv.py`
- Added detailed docstrings to `makecv.py`
- Fixed bugs in `mdpeople.py` and improved its tests
- Verified that other CLI utilities have good docstrings
